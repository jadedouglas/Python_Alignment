The first task is just to get the algorithm to run. Local alignment
- make the matrix with the strings displaying horizontally and vertically (like last semesters perl assignment)
- fill in the matrix with the representative values. 
- do the trace back effect
- alignmnet output
*Do we want to show the progressive states or do you just want them to provide the 2 strings and the final alignment result. 

Use the local alignment to create a global alignmnet. 
(if we have time we could map the protein alignment to the PAM250 matrix and stuff).
(web app if you feeling bored).
